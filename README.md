#User Story

I was tasked with creating a timed quiz.  The idea was to present each question one at a time, keep score and to subtract time for wrong answers.  At the end you should be able to save your score and initials.


#What I did

What I ended up with was a quiz created using forms. I initially tired to create each question within a bootstrap grid to allow for each question to appear on its own.  As I was not successful at utilizing the bootstrap in this way I changed the quiz template to form to allow for a version of a quiz to still be rendered.  Initially my quiz did have a spot to show your score and save your initials. However, once I added in JS to account for starting the quiz it didn’t not function as needed.  I decided to put some effort in to how the quick looked, aesthetically speaking, since I didn’t meet all the criteria outlined for me.

I am still learning coding and JavaScript has proven to be a tough mountain to climb.
